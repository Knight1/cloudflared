A docker container which runs the [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/cloudflared-proxy/) proxy-dns at port 54 based on alpine with some parameters to enable DNS over HTTPS proxy for [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) based on tutorials from [Oliver Hough](https://oliverhough.cloud/blog/configure-pihole-with-dns-over-https/) and [Scott Helme](https://scotthelme.co.uk/securing-dns-across-all-of-my-devices-with-pihole-dns-over-https-1-1-1-1/)

## Getting Started

Replace ```amd64``` with ```arm64``` or ```arm``` for RaspberryPi etc.

### Start with Port 54 (Default Port is 53!)

Port 54 on host network so every device on the network can reach the Proxy

```docker run -d --name cloudflared --restart=always --net host knight/cloudflared-dns:amd64```

### Start with Port 53

You can set up this Host to be a normal DNS resolver you can put into every client like with 8.8.8.8 or inside your router.

Examples: [Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-servers-on-most-popular-routers-2617995), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17191538/how-to-change-dns-routers-windows-mac-ios)

```docker run -d --name cloudflared --restart=always -p 53:54/udp knight/cloudflared-dns:amd64```

### Pi-holeÂ®: (A black hole for Internet advertisements)

Install Docker ```curl install.docker.com | sudo bash``` and [Pi-hole](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole/)

```docker run -d --name cloudflared -p 127.0.0.1:54:54/udp --restart=always knight/cloudflared-dns:amd64```

Enter IP 127.0.0.1#54 into Custom 1 (IPv4) within the Pi-Hole Admin Page
